# Customer-Segmentation

Customer segmentation is a key marketing strategy where customers are divided into distinct groups based on shared characteristics. This project uses unsupervised learning techniques (specifically K-Means clustering) to segment customers based on key features such as age, income, and spending score. By understanding different customer clusters, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns, improve user experience, and increase conversion rates.


## Overview

This project analyzes customer data and groups individuals into distinct clusters using K-Means Clustering. The dataset used is the Mall Customer Segmentation Data which contains features like:

CustomerID

Gender

Age

Annual Income (k$)

Spending Score (1–100)

The primary goal is to:

Understand customer behavior.

Find optimal number of clusters.

Visualize cluster distribution for actionable insights.
## Features

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

🔍 Data Preprocessing and Feature Selection

🎯 Optimal Cluster Detection using Elbow Method

🧩 Customer Segmentation using K-Means

📈 Cluster Visualization in 2D space

📎 Easy to extend for real-world business cases


## Technology used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas – for data manipulation

NumPy – for numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Scikit-learn – for implementing K-Means clustering


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning, specifically K-Means clustering, can be applied to uncover hidden patterns in customer data. The resulting customer segments can be used to enhance business strategies such as personalized marketing, customer loyalty programs, and resource allocation.
